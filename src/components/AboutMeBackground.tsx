      <p>
        I'm a person who is eager to learn everything that life has to offer and
        go above and beyond at the tasks I'm given. I have extensive experience
        in volunteering, mechatronics engineering and working in
        customer-service area as well as management experience. I believe my
        most valuable asset is my ability to adapt and overcome any challenge
        that is thrown my way.
